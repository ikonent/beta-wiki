Perhaps web-page could have a indicator from the sessions so that user knows who has logged on.

Pressing enter in sign in page presses cancel button. Can cause confusion when using login or register page. (Causes no message).

When existing username is entered into the register form and the correct password is entered into the first password field login is performed. <- appears to work in local setting as intented.

Register form does not check whether second passwd is entered as same.

Omat viestit -page is grayish. Contrast between the backgound and text is not big enough.
